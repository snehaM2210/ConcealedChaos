### Introduction

Since 2013, millenials have seen a 47% increase in major- depression diagnoses. The overall rate increased from 3% to 4.4% among 18-34 years old. The reasons are not bounded nor they are instant, but it's observed that people between the age limit 18-34 are hit by failures in their lives(it may be career, Relationship , family problems etc.). They lack self motivation at the end and loose hopes from their life this gives a way to depression. Thus we through our website wish to give a guidance to handle all such circumstances by giving them motivation and presenting examples of others. Through our website people can share their failures and success stories in person or ananomously . This would build a strong community of motivated people who could combat all the life challenges and could reach the pinnacle.

We through our website help the people to interact with each other(this would also increase social interactivity).

We are more focused in finding the reasons for these above problems and to solve them together as a community. Our website is more or less like a social media app designed in such a way that people can share their story of lives, their success and failures. This would motivate others as well.
